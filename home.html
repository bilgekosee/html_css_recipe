      <h1 >Smart Snacking: Nourishing Your Body with Healthy Bites</h1>

      <p class="paragraph">Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves making wise choices not only during meals but also when it comes to snacking. Instead of reaching for a bag of chips or sugary treats, opt for nutrient-packed snacks that will keep you energized and satisfied throughout the day. Here are some delicious and simple snack ideas to help you stay on track:</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Greek Yogurt Parfait:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Layer low-fat Greek yogurt with fresh berries and a sprinkle of granola. This parfait is rich in protein, probiotics, and antioxidants, making it a perfect choice for a midday snack.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Hummus and Veggie Sticks:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Dip crunchy carrot, cucumber, and bell pepper sticks into a bowl of homemade hummus. Hummus is a great source of plant-based protein and fiber, while veggies provide essential vitamins and minerals.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Apple Slices with Nut Butter:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Slice up an apple and pair it with a tablespoon of almond or peanut butter. The combination of fiber from the apple and healthy fats from the nut butter creates a balanced and satisfying snack.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Trail Mix:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Create your own trail mix by combining nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and a touch of dark chocolate. It's a convenient and portable option for when you're on the go.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading" >Avocado Toast:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Spread mashed avocado on whole-grain toast and top it with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Avocado offers healthy fats and fiber, while whole-grain bread adds complex carbohydrates.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Rice Cake Delight:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Top a rice cake with cottage cheese, sliced strawberries, and a drizzle of honey. This light and refreshing snack is a delightful mix of textures and flavors.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Smoothie Bowl:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Blend your favorite fruits with Greek yogurt and a splash of almond milk to create a thick smoothie. Pour it into a bowl and add toppings like chia seeds, nuts, and fresh fruit slices.</p>
  
      <p class="paragraph">Remember, the key to successful snacking is preparation. Having these wholesome ingredients on hand will make it easier to choose nourishing snacks over less nutritious options. So, the next time you feel those hunger pangs, treat yourself to a satisfying and healthful bite that fuels your body and keeps you going strong.</p>
